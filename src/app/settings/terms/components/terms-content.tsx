            Trading cryptocurrencies involves substantial risk and is not suitable for all investors. 
            The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. 
            Before deciding to trade cryptocurrencies, you should carefully consider your investment 
            objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-6">
            The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment 
            and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
